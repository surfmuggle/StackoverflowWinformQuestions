<table border="1"><tbody><tr><td>
<b>To install the extension, follow this procedure:<br></b>
- download the xpi file that you find in this page or in the homepage, right clicking on the link and choosing
"Save target as";<br>
- in Thunderbird, go in "Tools" --&gt; "Addons" (or "Extensions") and click on "Install";<br>
- pick the xpi file you downloaded and follow the instructions;<br>
- restart Thunderbird.
</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
<p> Important notes:<br><br>
<i>IMPORT</i><br>
- if the mbox file is not standard, you'll have a warning and you can try to import the file the same, because sometimes the import can work also with mbox files a little corrupted;<br>
- at the name of mbox file, it will be added a random number from 1 to 999, to avoid coincidence of names with the other folders (from 2.3.3 version, this happens just when it's necessary);<br>
- the files are imported as they were all of received mails, so it's shown the sender and not the receiver. If you want that it's shown the receiver, you must import the file as subfolder of the "Sent";<br>
- you can't import mbox files in IMAP or NEWS accounts or folders;<br>
- you can import EML files in IMAP accounts just with TB3 and version 2.3.3 or higher;<br>
- you can import more mbox file with one click;<br>
- because of a limit in filepicker itself, importing a big number of eml files can fail (if the total number of the chars of their names is more than 4096). You can bypass this limit, using the option to import all the eml files existing in a directory;<br>
- from the 2.2 version, it's possible to import also messages saved from "View-source"in Hotmail website.<br>
SMS import (experimental): from 2.4.2 version, it's possible to import SMS in the format generated by the programs <a href="http://android.riteshsahu.com/apps/sms-backup-restore">"SMS Backup and Restore"</a> and <a href="http://www.simail.si/nokia2androidsms/">"Nokia2AndroidSMS"</a>.
<br><br>
<i>EXPORT</i><br>
- the exported file is automatically renamed, if necessary. You can anyway overwrite the files with the same name, if you enable this option in the extension preferences;<br>
- if you choose to export all the mail folders of the account or also the subfodlers, will be exported all the folders that aren't empty file;<br>
- with IMAP or NEWS folders, the export in mbox format will work just for the single folder, even without the "offline" option enabled;<br>
- if the account is very large, the export can take some time, especially with IMAP or NEWS folders;<br>
- in the status bar, you can see the progress of export;<br>
- the extension can import and export the folders with their subfolders, keeping their structure. To export in this way, choose from the "Import/Export" menu the item "Export folder with subfolders (with structure)" and you'll have a file, with the folder name, and a directory, with the folder name plus ".sbd". To import, choose from the import dialog the item "Import one or more mbox files, with its/their subdirectory" and select just the mbox file;<br>
- export of messages in plain text can be not perfect;<br>
- in messages export, it is used the subject to build the filename, converting the not-ascii chars in "_". You can avoid this conversion, choosing the option about it in extension preferences (Note: from 1.2.1 version by default the extension uses the original chars).<br>
- export in HTML or plain text format <b>DOESN'T SAVE</b> the attachments, like happens usually in Thunderbird. If you need to export/save messages with their attachments, use the EML or the mbox format.<br>
- copy to clipboard, when it's possible, is in HTML format; if you want it always in text format, you can choose this option in preferences panel (Note: this can give compatibility problems pasting in other programs);<br>
- export all messages of a folder, the files will have the name created by subject+index+date. If you prefer the order
date+subject+index, enable this option in preferences panel;<br>
- from 2.1.1 version, you can set the file time with the date of the message. This option is disabled by default and you can enable it setting the preference "mboximport.export.set_filetime" to true;<br>
- usually export in HTML format reproduces the original HTML of the message, even it's displayed just as text. If you want to
export in HTML respecting the view options of Thunderbird, you must enable, in preferences panel, the option "HTML format as displayed in messages panel". <b>NOTE:</b> this option can fix, in some cases, encoding problems due to
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=384127">bug 384127</a>;<br>
- from 2.2 version you can set predefined directories for export.
</p>
<p>At the present the extension has italian, english, spanish, slovak, catalan, japanese, russian, french, portoguese, hungarian, dutch, korean, chinese, danish, galician, swedish, german. Some locales could be unfinished. If you are interested in traslating the extension in other languages, please do it through <a href="http://www.babelzilla.org/">Babelzilla project</a>.</p>
<p><b>Known issues:</b><br>
- export folders with structure has some bugs and for this reason some features don't work well;<br>
- some localizations could be unfinished.</p>
<p>The extension is compatible with Thunderbird 1.0 - 9 and has the autoupdate enabled.</p>
<p><b>Backup:</b> from 2.6 version, when you use always the same directory for backup (with customized name), after the first time, just the files changed since last backup will be saved again.
This will make backups much faster.<br>
In 2.5 series the backup function used a "modal" window; in 2.6 series, the window was set as normal. This choice is surely better,
but unluckly it seems not to work properly in some systems.<br>
For this reason it's now available the preference named "mboximport.autobackup.use_modal_dialog", that will set the window
as "modal" if its value is "true and as "normal" if its value is "false". The default value - from 2.6.0.3 version - is "true".
